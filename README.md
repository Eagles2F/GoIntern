3 Key things:
Goal + Company List + Connections

I got two version of it.
One subfolder named AppInventor_version is made from this cool tool: http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/
This is a cool and easy tool to do the fast prototyping. I'm also helping the open source community to improve it.

Another subforlder named AndroidSDK_version is going to be made from normal android SDK. I havent finished it yet.

That's all. Enjoy the fun!
